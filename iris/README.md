# Will experiment with classifier models with this particular data set.
This data set has the make up that will lend itself to using classifier models.
Thgs is because the data has labels or features that can be mapped to from intelegent ml reasioning after discovery through the training dataset.



Types of classifier models:

```
[x] naive bayes
[x] k-nearest neighbors
[x] logistic regression
[x] linear regression
[x] SVM (Supprt Vector Machines)
[x] Decision Trees
[x] Random Forests
[x] Gradient Boosting Machines
```

Will rank and tweak with hyperparameters to come up with the best positioned model

No hyperparameters optimization
